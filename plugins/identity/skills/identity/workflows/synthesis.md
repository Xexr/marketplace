# Synthesis Workflow

Weekly review that transforms interrupt logs into visible progress and actionable insights. This is where the daily discipline pays off.

## Prerequisites

- `[outputPath]/framework.md` - their identity framework
- `[outputPath]/interrupt-log.md` - at least 3-5 interrupts to analyze

If framework missing: direct to `/identity transformation`
If interrupt log missing or < 3 entries: "You need a few more interrupts before synthesis will be useful. Try `/identity interrupt` a few more times this week."

## The Synthesis Flow

### 1. Load the Data

Read both files. Count total interrupts, alignment rate, and patterns.

### 2. The Numbers

Present clearly:

```
This Week's Interrupts: [X]
Aligned with emerging identity: [Y] ([%])
Protected old pattern: [Z] ([%])
Mixed/unclear: [N]
```

If they have prior weeks, show trend:
```
Week 1: 33% aligned → Week 2: 50% aligned → This week: 65% aligned
```

### 3. Pattern Analysis

Look across all logged interrupts for:

**Triggers:** When does the old pattern show up?
- Time of day patterns (afternoon slump, post-meeting, evening)
- Situational triggers (after conflict, when tired, when uncertain)
- Emotional triggers (anxiety, boredom, overwhelm)

**Escape Routes:** How does the pattern manifest?
- Specific avoidance behaviors (scrolling, researching, rewriting, snacking)
- Which escapes are decreasing vs. persistent

**Choice Points:** What do successful interrupts have in common?
- Did they catch it early?
- What reframe worked?
- What conditions made alignment easier?

Present as direct observations:
> "Your pattern shows up most in afternoons (5 of 8 interrupts). Your escape route is usually research rabbit holes. When you caught yourself early, you chose alignment 4 out of 4 times."

### 4. Framework Check

Compare logged behavior against their stated framework:

**Identity Statement Test:**
> "You said 'I am the type of person who ships without perfectionism.' Your interrupts show perfectionism triggered 6 times. You chose to ship anyway 4 times. The identity is working as a decision filter."

**Pattern Accuracy:**
> "You identified perfectionism as the pattern. The data supports this - OR - The data suggests [X] might be a deeper driver. You avoided [specific behavior] even when perfectionism wasn't the stated reason."

**Goal Progress:**
> "Your one-month goal: 'Ship 2 features without excessive polish.' Based on interrupts + what you've shared, you've shipped [X]. [On track / Needs adjustment]."

### 5. Framework Refinements

Based on the data, suggest refinements:

**If pattern was misidentified:**
> "Consider updating your pattern from 'perfectionism' to 'conflict avoidance' - that's what the interrupt data actually shows driving behavior."

**If daily actions aren't working:**
> "Your morning time blocks are holding (3/3 aligned). Afternoon blocks fail consistently. Consider restructuring - either protect afternoons differently or move important work to mornings."

**If identity statement needs evolution:**
> "Your original statement was about shipping. The interrupts reveal a deeper theme - it's really about trusting yourself. Consider: 'I am the type of person who trusts my first instinct.'"

Ask if they want to update the framework now. If yes, edit `[outputPath]/framework.md` with the refinements.

### 6. Next Week's Focus

Based on analysis, suggest ONE specific focus:

> "This week's focus: Catch the afternoon trigger earlier. When you notice post-lunch energy dip, that's the moment - not 20 minutes into the research rabbit hole."

Keep it singular and actionable.

### 7. Archive Option

If the log is getting long (20+ entries), offer to archive:
- Save current log to `[outputPath]/archive/interrupt-log-[date-range].md`
- Start fresh log while preserving cumulative stats in framework

## Monthly Depth Check

If it's been 4+ weeks since original transformation (check framework.md Generated date):

> "It's been [X] weeks since your initial excavation. Based on [Y] interrupts, here's what's evolved:
> - Your pattern understanding has [deepened/shifted]
> - Your identity statement [is holding / might need revisiting]
> - Your anti-vision [still resonates / has lost urgency]
>
> Would you like to do a fresh `/identity transformation` to update the framework?"

## Tone

- Data-first, not cheerleading
- Honest about what's working and what isn't
- Progress framed as information, not judgment
- Their own words and logged experiences as evidence
- Curious about patterns, not prescriptive about solutions

## Key Output

The user should leave with:
1. Clear picture of their alignment rate and trend
2. Specific triggers and escape patterns identified
3. One focused intention for next week
4. Optionally: updated framework document
