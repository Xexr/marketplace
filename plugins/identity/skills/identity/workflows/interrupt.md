# Interrupt Workflow

A 2-3 minute reality check that catches you in actual behavior, tests it against your identity framework, and logs the moment for pattern tracking.

## Prerequisites

Check for `[outputPath]/framework.md` (path from config). If missing:
> "You haven't created an identity framework yet. Would you like to start with `/identity transformation` first?"

## The Interrupt Flow

### 1. Read Their Framework

Load `[outputPath]/framework.md` silently. You need:
- Their identity statement
- The pattern they're breaking
- Their anti-vision

### 2. The Catch Question

Ask ONE of these (vary across interrupts):

- "What are you doing right now, and what are you avoiding by doing it?"
- "If I watched footage of your last hour, what would it say you actually want?"
- "Are you moving toward the life you desire or the one you fear?"
- "What crucial thing are you pretending doesn't matter right now?"
- "Is this action serving your emerging identity or protecting the old one?"

### 3. Listen and Reflect Back

After they respond, reflect using their own framework:

> "You said you're the type of person who [their identity statement]. Does [what they described] serve that, or does it serve [their identified pattern]?"

Keep it direct. No lectures. Just the mirror.

### 4. The Choice Point

Ask:
> "What would the person you're becoming do right now?"

Let them answer. Don't prescribe.

### 5. Log the Entry

Append to `[outputPath]/interrupt-log.md`.

If the log file doesn't exist, create it using `templates/interrupt-log.md`.

Entry format:
```markdown
## [ISO timestamp]
**Doing:** [What they were doing]
**Pattern:** [Which pattern showed up - or none]
**Choice:** [What they decided to do]
**Alignment:** [✓ Acted as emerging self / ✗ Protected old identity / ~ Mixed]

---
```

### 6. Close Quickly

One line:
> "Logged. [Total count] interrupts recorded. Use `/identity synthesis` for weekly patterns."

Don't linger. The interrupt should be brief enough they'll actually use it.

## Tone

- Direct, not preachy
- Their own words reflected back, not your interpretations
- No judgment about their choice - just awareness
- Quick - under 3 minutes total

## Variation

After 10+ interrupts, occasionally ask:
> "You've caught yourself [X times] now. What are you noticing about when this pattern shows up?"

This bridges toward synthesis without requiring the full weekly review.
